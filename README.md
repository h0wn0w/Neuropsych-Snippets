##Neuropsych Report Writing Snippets

This is an ever-growing collection of TextExpander snippets that I use for writing neuropsych reports. These range from single words that I don't feel like typing over and over (e.g., impaired; lazy, I know) to fill-in templates for mental status exams. I've even created a report-skeleton with a few basic headings if I *really* want to write a report from scratch, without *actually* writing a report from scratch.
